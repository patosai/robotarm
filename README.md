Science Olympiad Robot Arm
================

Ah, high school. Stuyvesant High School.
Speaking of which, has an awesome Science Olympiad Tech Team! TTT woohoo!!

This code is for our 2013 "Robot Arm," centered around an Arduino Mega 2560. 8th place in the state competition, not bad!

This is where I got started in serious coding.
